# Console Fixer
Fixes the Console/F8 Menu's stack trace to show line numbers and file names for ultrakill assemblies.
###### (if you make a mod then you have to put the generated .pdb file next to your mods dll for it to have accurate line numbers)

it also redirects any BepInEx logs to PLog/F8 if uhm thats useful :3
